#npx is way of nicely running (and installing) apps in modules folder
npx create-react-app hotdog-rhythm-station # you may need to cd.. first
npm install react-music 
# <create blank github repo>
git remote add origin git@github.com:mcmonkeys1/hotdog-rhythm-station.git

# install material-ui
npm install @material-ui/core typeface-roboto @material-ui/icons
# import 'typeface-roboto';

...
OK we managed to cobble together the React UI, using React to manage state, and using Materials-UI components
	There's something weird happening with TextField type="number" - it's working somehow by throwing away undefined text input. Lovely lack of documentation.
Adding react-music was relatively painless after much research.
We're now attempting Arweave integration. Updating here as first step is to upload samples to the permaweb be used by the app:
...OK so there are no data standards, but we have data tags. Messaged the Arweave guys: apart from 'Content-Type' do whatever you want. Maybe we can use:
'Content-Type': audio/wav -see https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ema-vpim-wav-00
For pattern/song saves use:- application/json. Serialize objects including sequences & samples URIs
I saw ArweaveID using 'App-Id': 'arweave-id'

I think I should definitely have a name tag! e.g. 'Name': 'file.wav'
Research:

	OK, did a quick test with chrome extension (safe-mode off???).  It uploaded a .wav file as a webpage here: 
		http://arweave.net/XkfltfSIO7s2jQFh53Xa6oMeXGB09QJv0Mx8M432DPY
		Content-Type: text/html
		User-Agent: ArweaveChrome/2.1.3
		page:url: http://hotdogsystems.com/TR909_kick_hi.wav
		page:title: <this is usually grabbed form the html I guess>
		page:timestamp: 1560582713
	This is a dead end.

	Extend React-Music:
		We will need to make changes to React-Music :-( We can include any github project! :-) See link... 
		(https://medium.com/@jonchurch/use-github-branch-as-dependency-in-package-json-5eb609c81f1a)
		npm install mcmonkeys1/react-music
		-we can do branch installs with: npm install mcmonkeys1/react-music#MY_BRANCH_NAME

	TODO: use ArweaveID to display login: https://github.com/shenwilly/arweaveID

OK, we're back. Just coded the login, so we have the wallet. Now to save project files
	-serialize state.
	-Tags:
		'App-Id': `${process.env.npm_package_name}`
		'App-Version': `${process.env.npm_package_version}`
		'File-Name': <the name of the file>
		'Unix-Time': `${Date.now()}`
	-test our solution

npm install arweave
npm install react-toastify

OK I have made some new project decisions as this is taking too long:
1	-save to one project file without asking user for input
	& always open the latest version of the file from permaweb
2	-hardcode the wav sample files as base64 JS
	we still need to add features to react-music to accept ArrayBuffer!\
** 1 & 2: This means we can leave all the FileDialog stuff for another re-useable project =)
3	-leave out other niceties, this is supposed to be proof of concept
		ignore checking for remaining arweave balance
		do not add features to add remove channels
		absolute minimum controls for each channel -Name & Volume (material-ui slider)
